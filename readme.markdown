PS
==

The following code is my first Rust program (after Hello World).

I'm trying to create a simple process list application for the CLI that will
tech me some of the language syntax and ways to understand the code.

The code is not intended to be as a rust developer will write it, but rather
as a person that learn any language (including human) will use when forced to use
a language they do not know.
